Base scripts for flow cytometry analysis.

This repository has basic scripts for analyzing data from our Guava 11HT, generalizable to most flow cytometry instruments.  Some older scripts from our defunt CyFlow Space are also present.

fcm_model_AF.r - Constructs a model to classify autofluorescent data.

fcm_model_SG.r - Constructs a model to classify sybergreen data.

fcm_predict.r - Classifies data according to a model constructed by one of the other scripts.
